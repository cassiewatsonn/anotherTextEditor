## Usage

Here is a video displaying how to application works: [NoSQL-Social Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G_LUFaymvAIrMsf0j5eyzPwAQQEwlqy0/view)

After you have successfully installed the package (if you have not yet installed, please refer to [Installation](#installation)), run 'npm start' in your terminal you will get a message like this:

## ![npm start](./assets/images/npmstart.png)

This means the server is running! note: you will need the insomnia application to test the routes! Also, once you start the server, the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDb database. (See Images Below).

## ![Mongo 2](./assets/images/mongo2.png)

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. (See Below Images).

## ![User Get](./assets/images/userget.png)

## ![Thought Get](./assets/images/thoughtget.png)

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database. When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
